# SlapCityNoDI
Disables DI in Slap City

### Installation

If your game isn't modded with BepinEx, DO THAT FIRST! Simply go to the [latest BepinEx release](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases) and extract BepinEx_x64_VERSION.zip directly into your game's folder, then run the game once to install BepinEx properly.

Next, go to the [latest release of this mod](https://github.com/DeadlyKitten/SlapCityNoDI/releases/latest) and place the dll in `BepInEx/plugins`

The mod is now installed!

----------------------------------

#### Some Final Notes

- This mod will probably result in desync if used online, unless all players have a copy of the mod
- To restore DI to its functional state, simply remove the mod from your plugins folder
- This mod only affects DI, not SDI.
